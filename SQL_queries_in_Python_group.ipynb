It&#x27;s a very popular restaurant and it does get very crowded. It is a bit touristy due to its location right by the beaches. Also, it&#x27;s convenient because they have the ability to seat large groups. You will see many large groups of vacationers at this restaurant. They have a big parking lot but it fills quickly.  There is street parking as well. <br><br>Conch Republic is not a fancy restaurant.  It&#x27;s more of a casual after the beach restaurant. The prices are reasonable and you get plenty to eat. <br><br>For appetizers I love their old bay peel and eat shrimp and I order the warm version, it&#x27;s delicious. Another appetizer favorite is the fried zucchini. I don&#x27;t know what they do but It&#x27;s very light and yummy!  FYI...Keep in mind if you order this, they put grated cheese over it!  Actually, they put grated cheese over many items. If you are like me and prefer no cheese make sure to mention that when you order!!  For dinner I&#x27;ve tried many of their entrees. The coconut crusted mahi-mahi is my absolute favorite and it&#x27;s served with a warm mango chutney on top. I&#x27;ve also tried the St. Martin Shrimp scampi, the tacos, the coconut shrimp, the combo shrimp platters and many entrees multiple times!  They are always fresh and delicious. Their side salad that comes with some dinners is also delicious!  They also serve a bread basket. <br><br>They offer a happy hour everyday from 11am - 7pm.

We were a group of 6 (3 couples), and asking (IMO) for the most annoying request of all diners to &quot;split the plates.&quot;  But WE didn&#x27;t ask, she just DID it based on what we ordered.  None of that bring an extra plate for you to split the portions yourself, she had the kitchen split the food, including splitting salads that came with meals, and sandwiches.  That&#x27;s in addition to refilling drinks, removing plates, checking in that we were happy, etc.... Simply amazing!  I wish I lived nearby, so I could dine here more often.<br><br>Our table, as a whole ordered so much food, I&#x27;d never be able to keep it straight, so I&#x27;ll share what I remember.<br><br>My fiance and I started with a dozen raw oysters, which were delicious.   For the main meal we ordered the Mahi Mahi BLT and some kind of appetizer sampler, that featured conch fritters, an islamorada crab cake, and coconut shrimp.<br><br>The conch fritters were great -- little hush puppies with conch inside.<br>The crab cake was packed with jumbo lump crab meat, and the remoulade was to die for.  <br>The star was the coconut shrimp.  I was stunned as I thought this would be the least exciting, but they definitely stole the show.<br>Our Mahi BLT was also delicious!  It tasted so good, but I was so full from everything else, that I had to remove the bread and just eat the good stuff in the middle.<br>We also tried a few of the Mussels Diablo.  I will order those for sure,  when I get to come back to the Clearwater area.<br><br>Overall,  this was an a fantastic meal with even better service. <br><br>To the owners --- Please keep the high standards you have in place, as I can&#x27;t wait to return to dine here again.

Our waitress came to the table and we ordered drinks and the fish spread appetizer along with our meals which included salmon salad and the coconut shrimp that came with a house salad and my side was asparagus. Well my salad came out along with rolls. Let me start off by saying the Conch has the worst house salad which includes finely chopped iceberg lettuce, onions and broken nacho chips= zero. Well we finished the salad the rolls and sat there for a good 10 minutes afterwards waiting on fish spread or the waitress. Finally she appears serves the other table, the one next to us and is looking at us with a blank stare. I said &quot;is there any word on our fish spread? She said Oh they didn&#x27;t bring it out? Huh? Ok let me check on it. About five minutes after we left out meals came but no appetizer! So we started eating our meals and here comes out fish spread by another server/ manager maybe and he says you ordered the fish spread? I said yes but as an appetizer. So he offered us to keep the fish spread and they would comp. Ok.. Well let me go on about my coconut shrimp which was the worst I have ever eaten! It was dried out and disgusting. The dressing bowel for the shrimp is tiny, you can&#x27;t even fit the shrimp in the dipping container. This particular meal is listed as BEST on the menu and cost 16.95. However when I FINALLY received my check it was 17.95. Well meal eaten still no waitress drink has been empty since I received my my main course. The waitress comes out and says takes our dishes and says would you like another drink? I said yes I would like a refill and she never comes back with my drink! She is literally standing at a station cleaning salt and pepper shakers and blank stare again! We ordered a to go sandwich and asked for take home box for our dogs. She comes out again with the boxes and sandwich and proceeds to ask my wife piece by piece of what she wanted in the take away box! I have never seen this before! Ever!

I say no, she brings me some water, and says my server would come by in a minute.  So I waited...and waited...and waited...the water was wet and cold...there was a slice of lemon in the water....I waited...and waited....finally I got up, approached the hostess, thanked her for seating me, and told her  that I was disappointed, not going to wait any longer, and I was leaving to go elsewhere.  Had previously enjoyed great service and delicious food at the Conch Republic - not this time.  At least the water was wet.  That&#x27;s all the positive I can say about this visit.  Good bye.</td>\n",

So there is that. <br><br>But today Dan from the kitchen who was referred to us as a manager and then claimed he was an owner and Amanda our server were astonishingly terrible. I mean I am flabbergasted. <br><br>I am a local and we eat here multiple times a week.  I know personally 4 of the other staff. <br><br>I was not even going to mention anything to the staff. I&#x27;m really not a complainer. BUT ANOTHER TABLE WITNESSING what was going on, who is also a local,who ALSO SAID they have had problems with Amanda, are actually the ones who told their server to send us a manger. That is how bad this was. <br><br>On top of Amanda screwing up most every part of her job. Order taking, reading customers and responding to them, bring stuff to the table. When we obviously complained about her service SHE NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED what she did. She just slapped a fake smile on (we can all tell the patronizing fakeness of your interactions with us. But please pretend you are just being pleasant and treat us like we are dumb and do not know how fake your smile is) <br><br>Yelling at us from across a patio over 6 different tables is also super inappropriate. Interrupting our conversations so you can be yelling from across the patio is also inappropriate. <br><br>Dropping the bill off and saying we comped you for the inconvenience and NOT ACKNOWLEDGING it was your poor service, is inappropriate.<br><br>I would rather pay full price for the meal and have you acknowledge your mistakes.<br><br>On top of it, my mom returning from the bathroom, wanted to return an ear piece and walkie talkie that one of the staff left in there. And walks up to hear Dan and Amanda disregarding us and talking about us to &quot;just leave&quot;. <br><br>So after Amanda offered us a bag, which we wanted, and she went to go get but came back bagless. (Prolly cause she offered it to us from across a patio and could not hear the answer) I went to her and asked for the bag and let her know this is the reason I am now escalating this to a bad review and her incapability to take responsibility for the poor service, instead of getting me the bag, she stood there and argued with me trying to justify why she in fact did not provide us with bad service (I know for a fact you made mistakes because when I had to go the the bar to get my drink fixed your bartender told me you did not ring it in that way. Mind you after our drink order was taken it took you over 10 mins to return with said drinks and it did not end there) that she is a happy person and not fake. So obviously Dan told her what we said and now you want to argue with me ON THE FLOOR. I had to tell HER, I&#x27;m not arguing with you just get me my bag. <br><br>I am the customer this is how you made me feel. Don&#x27;t argue with me, I&#x27;m entitled to the feelings I had from our experience. And Dan as an owner and even a manager, you should know not to talk about customers on the floor. Even if it had not been my mom who heard. Customers do not like to hear staff talk bad about customers. And when we talked to you at our table we were nothing but polite and sorry Amanda&#x27;s service was even brought to your attention. Sorry for the big hardship that you just wanted to make sure we were leaving.</td>\n",

I ordered soup the waiter brought out the same stale crackers. The waiter then cleared our table dropped the same stale crackers all over the floor. The manager did come over to ask us about our food, I mentioned the slow service, and food issues and guess what his response was? Oh I am sorry you food was not good. The waiter brought us the wrong bill which was for a large party. My wife and I ordered two basic meals, not rocket science here guys. Training is definitely an issue,  and it starts with the poor manager. With so many good choices do not waste your time on overpriced drinks, and substandard food, with poor service.

Our drinks weren&#x27;t refilled. Had to ask another server to get our salads. Our own server dropped them off but didn&#x27;t ask if we wanted refills on drinks or bread.
