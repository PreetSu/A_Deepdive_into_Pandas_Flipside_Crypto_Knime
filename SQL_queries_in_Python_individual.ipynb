If you are like me and prefer no cheese make sure to mention that when you order!!  For dinner I've tried many of their entrees. The coconut crusted mahi-mahi is my absolute favorite and it's served with a warm mango chutney on top.

I gave the person who answered the phone my Name for security purposes, the name of the credit card company,  the color of the card, what table I sat at, how many were in my party, and the amount. She then asked me was it a visa or mastercard?????? I simply asked do you have my credit card or not? so that I can call my bank and say that it was stolen or not. This person refused to even tell me if the card was there! They continued to give me a hard time to the point that I was forced to turn around and physically return to the restaurant.  When I got there I gave them my name and again asked for my card. It was given back to me immediately WITHOUT even checking my ID card or asking any questions.   I then proceeded to ask for a manager. I explained to him what his employee just did. He apologized but he missed the entire point. All the b.s on the phone but when I showed up in person the restaurant immediately handed over a credit card without asking for or looking at an ID card???????

One of us had the seafood pasta. It looked good but the mushrooms weren't cooked AT ALL. He also said it wasn't very flavorful. Another had the fried shrimp poboy. It's hard to mess that up. The shrimp was ok; cooked through w light breading, but they brought potato salad instead of fries when fries were ordered. They eventually brought fries though...and those were very good. The best part of the meal actually. None of the 3 of us said we would come back based on the food being very bland.

There was a medium crowd but not overly packed where service should be slow. Our waitress came to the table and we ordered drinks and the fish spread appetizer along with our meals which included salmon salad and the coconut shrimp that came with a house salad and my side was asparagus. Well my salad came out along with rolls. Let me start off by saying the Conch has the worst house salad which includes finely chopped iceberg lettuce, onions and broken nacho chips= zero. Well we finished the salad the rolls and sat there for a good 10 minutes afterwards waiting on fish spread or the waitress. Finally she appears serves the other table, the one next to us and is looking at us with a blank stare. I said \"is there any word on our fish spread? She said Oh they didn't bring it out? Huh? Ok let me check on it. About five minutes after we left out meals came but no appetizer! So we started eating our meals and here comes out fish spread by another server/ manager maybe and he says you ordered the fish spread? I said yes but as an appetizer. So he offered us to keep the fish spread and they would comp. Ok.. Well let me go on about my coconut shrimp which was the worst I have ever eaten! It was dried out and disgusting. The dressing bowel for the shrimp is tiny, you can't even fit the shrimp in the dipping container. This particular meal is listed as BEST on the menu and cost 16.95. However when I FINALLY received my check it was 17.95. Well meal eaten still no waitress drink has been empty since I received my my main course. The waitress comes out and says takes our dishes and says would you like another drink? I said yes I would like a refill and she never comes back with my drink! She is literally standing at a station cleaning salt and pepper shakers and blank stare again! We ordered a to go sandwich and asked for take home box for our dogs. She comes out again with the boxes and sandwich and proceeds to ask my wife piece by piece of what she wanted in the take away box! I have never seen this before! Ever! Overall service was horrible and the the food totally disgusting! This is saying a lot by a couple that has eaten at this restaurant a lot!!  P. S they were out of mussels.
